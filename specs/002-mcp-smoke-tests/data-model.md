# Data Model: Automated MCP Smoke Tests

## Overview
This increment does not introduce persistent data entities. The smoke tests
operate with runtime configuration only (port, timeouts, and expected tool name)
and do not store state.

## Entities
- None (no persistent storage or data lifecycle required).
